        <h2>Introduction to Xamarin.iOS (IOS101)</h2>
<p>The first step in becoming a Xamarin.iOS developer is getting an app up and running. This course takes you through the entire development process. You will create a new project in Visual Studio, code the user interface and behavior, build the project, and test it on an iPhone simulator. As you build your app, you will learn several iOS design patterns such as Model-View-Controller, protocols, and delegates.</p>
<h3>Upon completion you will be able to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify the Xamarin.iOS tools for Visual Studio</li>
<li>Describe the components of an iOS application</li>
<li>Add views and behavior to an iOS application</li>
</ul>
<h3>Course exercise download</h3>
<p>Exercise materials are available from <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/IOS101/">GitHub</a>. The code can be cloned through a desktop Git client or <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/IOS101/archive/master.zip">downloaded directly</a> as a ZIP file.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="parts/part1.html">Exercise 1: Create and run your first iOS application</a>
<br>
<p>The primary goal of this lab is to walk through the creation of a brand new Xamarin.iOS application using Visual Studio on either macOS or Windows. We will then build and run it using the included iOS Simulator from Apple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part2.html">Exercise 2: Add a root view controller to the Tip Calculator app</a>
<br>
<p>The primary goal of this lab is to disable the default Storyboard UI from the TipCalculator project you created in the previous exercise and replace it with a code-based <code>UIViewController</code> which will be set as the <code>RootViewController</code> for the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part3.html">Exercise 3: Create the UI for a Tip Calculator</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, we will be adding three controls to our screen: a <code>UITextField</code>, a <code>UIButton</code> and a <code>UILabel</code> to complete the UI for a simple Tip Calculator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part4.html">Exercise 4: Add logic to your Tip Calculator</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, we will add the business logic to our Tip Calculator app by handling the tap event on the button and calculating the tip amount. This logic is the Model for our application. </p>
</li>
</ol>
